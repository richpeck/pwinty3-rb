# Pwinty3

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

This wraps the Pwinty API at version 3 and aims to make your ruby life easier when interacting with the API.

See http://pwinty.com and https://pwinty.com/api for more details around teh core service.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pwinty3'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pwinty3

## Configuration
You can use environment variables or you can declare the configuration in your app.

#### Authentication
To authenticate requests you must get your merchant ID and API Key from the
[Integration Settings in the Pwinty Dashboard](https://beta-dashboard.pwinty.com/settings/integrations).

These values must be set as the Environment Variables `PWINTY3_MERCHANT_ID` and `PWINTY3_API_KEY`
or declared in your app using:

```ruby
Pwinty3::MERCHANT_ID = 'your merchant id'
Pwinty3::API_KEY = 'your api key'
```

#### Production vs Sandbox
The Pwinty API provides a sandbox endpoint to test and develop against at `https://sandbox.pwinty.com`. This is the default
endpoint used by this library.

When you are ready to switch to the production endpoint, set the Environment Variable `PWINTY3_BASE_URL` or declare the
constant in your app:

``` ruby
Pwinty3::BASE_URL = 'https://api.pwinty.com'  # Without a trailing slash
```

## Usage

#### Create an order

These are the minimum variables you need to send to the API to register your order, you'll want to add more or update later.

See the `lib/pwinty3/order.rb` file or the [API documentation](https://pwinty.com/api/#orders-create)
to understand the full list of attributes to send.

``` ruby
order = Pwinty3::Order.create(
	recipientName: "FirstName LastName",
	countryCode: "US",
	preferredShippingMethod: "Budget"
)
```

This create method will return a `Pwinty3::Order` object.

#### Update an order

Using the `order` object created in the above, we can update this using:

``` ruby
updated_order = Pwinty3::Order.update(
	order,
	address1: '1 Street',
)
```

This update method will return a new `Pwinty3::Order` object.

NB - Orders are immutable - you cannot run `order.update`
you must pass an order object into the `Pwinty3::Order.update` method.

#### Validate an order

Before submitting you might want to validate the order and check all is well.

``` ruby
status = order.submission_status
```

This will return a `Pwinty3::OrderStatus` object. See the [Api documentation](https://pwinty.com/api/#orders-validate)
for more details of the shape of this reponse. But, you'll at least want the `status.isValid` method for a boolean
check to see if it can be submitted.

#### Add an Image to your Order

TODO - pretty important piece left to do!


#### Submit, Cancel or Hold an order

Before you submit you should run Validate and ensure there are no errors.

``` ruby
submitted? = order.submit

cancelled? = order.cancel

held? = order.hold
```

These methods will either submit your order for processing, or cancel/hold the processing. All return a boolean.

#### List your orders

``` ruby
orders = Pwinty3::Order.list
```

Will return an array of `Pwinty3::Order` objects.

#### Count your orders

``` ruby
count = Pwinty3::Order.count
```
Will return an integer of the number of orders you have.



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

The tests use VCRs to mock the responses from Pwinty's API.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
